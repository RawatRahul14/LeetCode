    "### Self-Balancing Trees and AVL Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "A *self-balancing binary tree* remains balanced after insertion or deletion. Several decades of research has gone into creating self-balancing binary tree, and many approaches have been devised e.g. B-tree, Red Black Tree, and AVL (Adelson-Velsky Landis) Trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Self-balancing in AVL tree is achieved by tracking the balance factor (difference between the height of left subtree and the right subtree) for each node and *rotating* unbalanced subtrees along the path of insertion/deletion to balnce them."
